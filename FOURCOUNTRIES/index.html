                <h2>Japan</h2>
               
                <p>
                    Japan is an island country in East Asia. It is situated in the Pacific Ocean, off the eastern coast of the continent of Asia. Japan consists of over 6,800 islands, with four main islands, Shikoku, Kyushu, Hokkaido, and Honshu, making about 97% of the country’s land area. It is the 10th largest country in the world with a population of approximately 127 million people. The majority of the population (98%) are ethnic Japanese. Japan is one of the most highly developed countries in the world. It has a very high standard of living, with its population enjoying the highest life expectancy. The country has been long known for the influential music industry, extensive cinema, and rich cuisine.
                    <ol>Forestry
                        While Japan has a small land area (approximately 145,937 square miles), the land is mainly covered with forest. Approximately 68.2% of the Japanese land is under the forest cover, the world’s 4th highest percentage after Laos, Finland, and Bhutan, and far ahead of countries such as the US, Britain, France, and China. Japan’s forest has the potential for increasing export and employment opportunities. The demand for high-quality timber from China and South Korea is rising very fast.</ol>
                        <ol>Fisheries
                            Fish is considered the main natural resource of Japan. The territorial waters of Japan and its exclusive economic zone is the 6th largest in the world, covering approximately 4.5 million square kilometers. Fishing has been a major economic activity in Japan. The country has been known for deep-sea fishing and whaling. However, following the 1973 energy crisis, fishing in Japan declined with annual catch averaging 2 million tons in the 1980s. During the same period, offshore fishing accounted for 50% of the total catch. Both the domestic and overseas fishing in Japan has always been centered on the Tsukiji fish market, Tokyo. The fish market is one of the largest wholesale fish markets in the world, especially for frozen, processed, and fresh fish. Japan has over two thousand fishing ports including Otaru, Nagasaki, Kushiro, and Abashiri.</ol>

                <h2>Morocco</h2>
                <p>Morocco is an African nation situated on the continent's northern edge and covers an area of 172,414 square miles. Morocco has one of the most developed economies in Africa. The Moroccan economy is thought to be relatively liberal and is highly dependent on the country's natural resources which include fish, arable land, spectacular natural landscapes, and its vast phosphate reserves among others.</p>
                <ol>Grapes
                    Moroccan farmers grow several varieties of grapes such as the Carignan, Grenache, and Cinsaut. In the past, most Moroccan farmers grew Carignan; however, its popularity declined. The Moroccan government estimated that in 2005, Cinsaut accounted for approximately 40% of the grapes grown in the country. In recent times, Moroccan farmers have begun experimenting with several grape varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay. Morocco has five distinct grape-growing areas which are further subdivided into 14 distinct regions. During the 1990s, the Moroccan government sought the help of the French to improve the country's wine industry. The project was relatively successful and in 2014 the Moroccan government estimated that the country produced 400,000 hectoliters of wine</ol>

                <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
                <p>The UK has a lot of natural resources, including fossil fuels for energy, crops for food, and livestock for food as well as clothes.

                    Resources related to farming are called agricultural resources, these include:
                <ul>
                    <ol>crops which produce wheat and barley</ol>
                    <ol>livestock such as cows, pigs and chickens which produce dairy, eggs and meat</ol>
                    <ol>sheep which produce wool and leather</ol>
                </ul>
                Resources found underground are called geological resources, these include:
                <ol>sheep which produce wool and leather</ol>
                <ol>Oil And Natural Gas
                    In 2014, the UK produced about 1.42 million Barrels of Oil Equivalents (BOE) every day, which is the unit of energy derived from the average energy released from 1 barrel of crude oil, and out of this 59% were oil or liquids. The United Kingdom consumed about 1.508 million barrels of oil per day in 2013 and about 2.735 trillion cubic feet of gas. Currently, the country is importing hydrocarbons, although it has been exporting the commodity from the 1980s to 1990s. For a long time, gas was produced in the Southern North Sea in the Morecambe Bay, but presently there has been a decline. In the recent past, there have been discoveries in regions with the most challenge especially in the west of Shetland. By 2012, there were approximately 9,774 miles of pipeline that connected about 113 oil installations and about 189 different gas installations.</ol>

                        <ol>Metals
                            Italy exports large quantities of steel, and it is currently the 7th largest exporter in the world, and by June 2017 the country had exported 8.8 million metric tons of steel. In 2016, Italy’s export of steel accounted for about 4% of all the steel exported worldwide. The country's steel export in 2016 was slightly bigger than that of Belgium and slightly under one-third of the size of China's export, which is the largest exporter in the world. Regarding value, steel exports represented 6% of all exports in Italy in 2016. Italy exports steel to more than 170 countries and territories worldwide.</ol>
                            <ol>Minerals
                                For a long time, Italy has been the world’s 13th biggest producer of cement until 2010 when its production dropped by about 5% as a result of the declining output in the construction sector in the country. Sienese and Carrara marbles from Italy are popular and are recognized worldwide for their natural qualities. Marble is extracted in different locations in the country from Sicily to the Alps. The Apuan Alps produces the white marble which is popular and famous which accounted for about one-third of the 100,000 tons of white marbles produced in the country while other regions like Lazio, Sicily, Verona-Vincenza, Po Valley, Lombardy, Venice, and Puglia are the major producers of colored marble.</ol>
