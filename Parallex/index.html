                        <p>Agriculture is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of
                        sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live
                        in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least
                        105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were
                        domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. Industrial
                        agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about
                        2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture.

                        <b>Commercial grain farming– </b>Just as the name suggests, in this method, farmers grow grains and trade them in the market.
                    Wheat and maize are the most common crops of commercial grain farming. Farmers of Asia, Europe, temperate grasslands of
                    North America generally practice this type of farming.
                    <br>
                   <b>Plantation farming–</b>
                   Plantation farming is a mix of agriculture and industry and is practised across a vast area of land.
                    Plantation owners usually grow a single crop like banana, coffee, tea etc. in a plantation and use technological support
                    to process the crop on the farm itself or a factory attached to it. The end product also works as a raw material for
                    industries. For example, the rubber industry uses the rubber produced from its plantation as raw material.
                    Mixed farming– This farming method involves cultivation of crops, rearing livestock and growing their fodder. It is a
                    common practice in parts of USA, Australia, and New Zealand, Europe, and South Africa to do mixed farming for a living.</p>

                            profits. Its also a way of delivering fresh food to the planet. Following the recent change in climate which as to do with deforestation, we aim to connect farmers with oppoirtunity to work and grow plants to sustain the palnet. We haave various choice, you dont need to have a land to partake in this massive project.</div>
